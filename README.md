# Rhythm Drums Game Prototype [WIP]
 This is a prototype of an idea I had in a dream (and I really liked). 
 Most of this was made in less than a week but I'm planning to add a tutorial and make a small playable version.

The main mechanic is the movement between tiles following the music. However, every tile has its own symbol and color. The symbol 
defines a kick drum pattern the player must play before moving again to another tile, and the color means it can be a special tile,
with effects that modify the music's tempo or rhythm.
